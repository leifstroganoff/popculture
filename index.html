            <h2>The Chick Flick Effect</h2>
            <p>This project was an analysis of "girl's" media. Most media that gets written off because of it's intended audience is often quite brilliant, or it has reason to be appreciated still. I used this project as a way to talk about not only the media that's left forgotten, but the cultural reasons that it's looked down upon. This project consists of 5 articles about Chick Flicks, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Musicals, Jennifer's Body, and Taylor Swift.</p>

            <h2>James and the Shame</h2>
            <p>This is a cultural commentary piece I wrote for my popular writing class. I used James and the Shame's album <em>Human Overboard</em> to discuss my process of deconstructing my faith and how that is viewed in the wider social culture. I also argue the importance of music as a way to process difficult things and feel less alone.</p>

            <h2>Olivia Rodrigo - Guts</h2>
             <p>This is a review of Olivia Rodrigo's sophomore album <em>GUTS</em>. In the review, I discuss lyrical themes throughout the album, as well as how the sound is serviced by her paradoxically unique and relatable lyrics. I also discuss the weight of the expectations that society has placed on her as a young woman whose popularity blew up overnight when her debut song, drivers license, went viral on TikTok.</p>
